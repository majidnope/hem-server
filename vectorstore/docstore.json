In many instances it may be desirable to exceed minimum requirements to achieve optimum standards. Designers, operators and applicants for Health Facilities are encouraged to innovate and exceed these requirements wherever possible.

Therefore, the local Health Authority, its officers and the authors of these Guidelines accept no responsibility for adverse outcomes in Health Facilities even if they are designed or approved under these Guidelines.

This approach, in the hands of a skilled designer has many benefits. Modules can be designed  only once to perfection and repeated throughout the facility. No redesign is necessary to   adjust to  different planning configurations. Instead the plan is assembled to adapt to the modules. Errors in  both design and construction can therefore be minimised.  The opposite to this approach is to start from a different architectural shape for each   FPU, divide it  into various shapes for the rooms, then design the interior of each room independently.

Birthing Unit is a discreet Unit providing facilities for the safe prenatal care, delivery and immediate postnatal care of mothers and their newborn babies. The number of birthing rooms and the size of the associated service areas shall be as required by the proposed obstetrical workload outlined in the Service Plan. The Birthing Unit will form a component of the Obstetric or Maternity Unit. Within this unit, patients with specific needs will be taken into consideration through the creation of dedicated zones:     Mothers having normal deliveries     Mothers suffering from antenatal or postnatal complications, requiring acute care     Newborn babies requiring minimal care     Newborn babies requiring care for complications arising from medium risk factors     Newborn babies","metadata":{"source":"iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","filename":"iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","path":"/Users/revienstech/Desktop/hem-server/pdf/iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","loc":{"lines":{"from":194,"to":194}}}}],["529",{"pageContent":"or postnatal complications, requiring acute care     Newborn babies requiring minimal care     Newborn babies requiring care for complications arising from medium risk factors     Newborn babies requiring care for severe complications, in anticipation of a transfer to a Neonatal Unit of a higher delineation.

Models of Care  Maternity care including antenatal care, delivery and postnatal care may be provided in a number of different ways that will impact on the organisation and provision of facilities including:     Midwife-managed or midwife case load care, where care is delivered by a single midwife or by a group/team of midwives, from both hospital and community settings     Obstetrician-led care, where an","metadata":{"source":"iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","filename":"iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","path":"/Users/revienstech/Desktop/hem-server/pdf/iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","loc":{"lines":{"from":194,"to":194}}}}],["530",{"pageContent":"Midwife-managed or midwife case load care, where care is delivered by a single midwife or by a group/team of midwives, from both hospital and community settings     Obstetrician-led care, where an Obstetrician is the main provider of antenatal care and is present for the birth.

Obstetric nurses or midwives perform intrapartum and immediate postnatal care but not at a decision making level as the Medical doctor is present during the birth.     Shared Care, which may include General Practitioners, Midwives, Obstetrician and/or Consultants (such as Neonatal Specialists).     Woman Centred Care where women have the choice of delivery method, practitioner and location, whether in hospital, in a Birthing Centre or at home.

These models are explained in greater detail below.

The LDRP model eliminates an additional move to postpartum care. Equipment is moved to the room as needed, rather than moving the patient to the equipped room.

Description  The purpose of the Community Health Unit (CHU) is to provide assessment, counselling, therapy, treatments, health education, community support and group programmes for outpatients. Community Health facilities can range from single rooms to multi-functional clinics and can either be integrated within a hospital campus or located in a stand-alone building. Community Health Services are typically delivered in a community based rather than hospital based setting. Specific requirements for the facility are determined by the range of services to be provided and may include primary health services, mental health services, health promotion and education.

Use of shared spaces and multi-purpose rooms reduce the need for potentially under-utilised special purpose rooms and may avoid duplication of equipment requirements.

function of the Emergency Unit is to receive, stabilise and manage patients (adults and children) who present with a large variety of urgent and non-urgent conditions whether self or otherwise referred. The Emergency Unit also provides for the reception and management of disaster patients as part of the Unit's role within each region. It is recommended that Hospitals not providing an Emergency Service display a prominent exterior sign at the main entrance stating this and giving the location of the nearest Hospital with an Emergency Service.  2   Functional and Planning Considerations  Operational Models  The Emergency Unit may be configured in a number of models that are aimed at improving efficiency of treatment and may influence facility design.

The majority of Emergency Units will have a number of these models in operation.  Triage and Registration  Patient assessment in Triage occurs first followed by initial registration by clerical staff. In this model, the Reception and Triage are collocated. The patient is rapidly assessed and assigned to the appropriate care zone. A variation of this model includes a senior Nurse to manage patients in the Waiting room to continually review patients who have been triaged and are awaiting treatment. This initiative may be implemented to improve patient safety and quality of care as the Nurse can escalate access to care as needed.

This allows for the magnification of an image to be projected onto a video screen for viewing and recording. Endoscopy can be used to examine organs or tissue for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. Endoscopy procedures may involve the taking of biopsies, dilations, retrieval of foreign objects and removal of stones from the bile duct. Procedures undertaken in an Endoscopy Unit may include gastrointestinal endoscopy (such as gastroscopy, colonoscopy, ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography), endoscopic ultrasound, bronchoscopy, cystoscopy or ureteroscopy,","metadata":{"source":"iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","filename":"iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","path":"/Users/revienstech/Desktop/hem-server/pdf/iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","loc":{"lines":{"from":707,"to":707}}}}],["1242",{"pageContent":"Unit may include gastrointestinal endoscopy (such as gastroscopy, colonoscopy, ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography), endoscopic ultrasound, bronchoscopy, cystoscopy or ureteroscopy, duodenoscopy, hysteroscopy or other specialties.

Some procedures, such as ERCP may also involve diagnostic imaging equipment. Most endoscopy procedures are performed on a same-day basis. Endoscopy procedures have advantages for both the facility and the patient including:     reduced demand on operating rooms     increased patient throughput as procedures are faster     procedures are less invasive (the endoscope is inserted through a natural opening) resulting in reduced scarring, quick recovery time and rapid discharge.  2   Planning  Operational Models  The range of options for an Endoscopy Unit may include:  ","metadata":{"source":"iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","filename":"iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","path":"/Users/revienstech/Desktop/hem-server/pdf/iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","loc":{"lines":{"from":707,"to":707}}}}],["1243",{"pageContent":"through a natural opening) resulting in reduced scarring, quick recovery time and rapid discharge.  2   Planning  Operational Models  The range of options for an Endoscopy Unit may include:     a dedicated fully self-contained unit within a hospital     a Unit collocated with the Operating Unit with shared facilities     a Unit collocated with a specialist clinical service such as Gastroenterology or Respiratory Medicine, within a hospital     a stand-alone centre/ Day Surgery centres, fully self-contained     Rural and Remote endoscopy services.

The Unit must also provide facilities and conditions to meet the needs of patients and visitors as well as the workplace requirements of staff.  Description  The Inpatient Unit is for general medical and surgical patients. In larger health facilities this Unit includes specialist medical and surgical patients, for example, cardiac, neurology/ neurosurgery, integrated palliative care and obstetric patients.

The physical environment should permit of a range of models of care to be implemented, allowing flexibility for future change.

A minimum of 20 % of the total bed complement shall be provided as Single Bedrooms in an Inpatient Unit used for overnight stay; the current trend is to provide a greater proportion of single bed rooms largely for infection control reasons.  Swing Beds  For flexibility and added options for utilisation it may be desirable to include provisions for Swing Beds. This may be a single bed or a group of beds that may be quickly converted from one category of use to another. An example might be long-stay beds which may be converted to acute beds.

Introduction  Description  Intensive Care is a dedicated unit for critically ill patients who require invasive life support, high levels of medical and nursing care and complex treatment. The intensive care unit provides a concentration of clinical expertise, technological and therapeutic resources which are coordinated to care for the critically ill patient.  2   Planning  Operational Models  The level of Intensive Care available should support the delineated role of the particular hospital. The role of a particular ICU will vary, depending on staffing, facilities and support services as well as the type and number of patients it has to manage.

There are a number of operational models applicable to intensive care units including:  Combined Critical Care  The Combined Critical Care may include a High Dependency Unit, Intensive Care and/or Coronary Care, often located in a rural or regional hospital where flexibility of bed utilisation is important. This will allow short and medium term intensive care patients to be managed appropriately when required, and at other times, the Unit may be used for the more common cardiology or high dependency patients. These Units have lower medical and nursing demands, and will usually be staffed on a nurse/patient ratio of significantly less than 'one to one'.

Hot Floor  The 'Hot Floor' model of Intensive Care can be collocated with specialty Intensive Care Units such as cardiothoracic, neurosurgical and general intensive care and may include a high dependency unit. A comprehensive ‘Hot Floor’ model may include collocation of ICU with Operating Unit, Emergency, CCU and parts or all of Medical Imaging.

IVF is one of several Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART) used to help infertile couples to conceive a child. The procedure involves removal of eggs (mature Oocyte or Ovum) from the woman's ovary. Ova are then fertilised with sperm in a laboratory procedure (in vitro). If fertilisation occurs, a fertilised ovum, after undergoing several cell divisions, is transferred to the mother for normal development in the uterus, or frozen for later implantation. The IVF laboratory may use Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) in the process of IVF. Services provided by the IVF Unit include:     Patient consultation and interview on an outpatient basis     Pre-treatment assessment     Blood collection     Semen","metadata":{"source":"iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","filename":"iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","path":"/Users/revienstech/Desktop/hem-server/pdf/iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","loc":{"lines":{"from":956,"to":956}}}}],["1518",{"pageContent":"(ICSI) in the process of IVF.

Description  Linen handling involves:     The collection of dirty linen on a regular basis     Processing of dirty linen including sorting, washing, drying and folding     Storage of clean linen and supply to inpatient and ambulatory care units on a regular basis. Linen processing may be done within the hospital facility or off-site in a commercial or shared laundry, depending on the Operational Policy. As a minimum, each facility shall have provisions for storage and exchange of clean and soiled linen for appropriate patient care.  2   Functional and Planning Considerations  Operational Models  Linen processing may be performed on-site in a separate facility or within the hospital.

Most commonly, linen processing is outsourced in a commercial arrangement with an external provider and delivered to the facility. The minimum service provided by the hospital will generally be a daily collection of dirty linen and daily delivery of clean linen to patient units.  Hours of Operation  The Linen Handling Unit will typically operate up to 12 hours per day, 7 days per week.

Imaging-Nuclear Medicine Unit - PET  1   Introduction  Description  Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine technology that uses short-lived radionuclides (tracers) injected into the body allowing non-invasive imaging of metabolic, biochemical and/or physiological function within the body. PET scanning now involves 3 dimensional images using CT or MRI scanning at the same time, which provides information about the body structure. Images from metabolic scanning and the CT/MRI are reconstructed using computer analysis. The function of a PET Unit is to provide a safe environment to enable the delivery of radiopharmaceutical agents and scanning under carefully controlled conditions. The Unit may be provided within the Nuclear Medicine Unit or Medical Imaging Unit.

Because of the short half-life of the supplied isotopes careful planning is needed with respect to patient scheduling and isotope deliveries that may require more than one delivery per day.

The Staff Station is a secured area, centrally located with patient recreation areas in direct view. Patient Bedrooms are provided along corridors visible from the staff base.  Collaborative Care Model  In this model, mental health care is a joint collaboration between clinical and non-clinical streams involving the patient, carers, community, consumers, carers, other professionals and clinicians.

Introduction  Description  The purpose of the Radiation Oncology Unit is to provide facilities and equipment for radiotherapy treatment. Mainly used for the treatment of cancer, radiotherapy is often used in conjunction with other treatments, including chemotherapy and surgery. The Radiation Oncology Unit contains spaces to support patient consultation, treatment simulation and planning, and the administration of treatment. The Radiation Oncology Unit may contain both external and internal radiotherapy (brachytherapy) treatment areas.

The Operating Unit provides a safe and controlled environment for the operative care of patients undergoing diagnostic/ surgical procedures under anaesthesia and peri-operative care including post

Surgery) which may include  -   Catheter Lab procedures  -   Endoscopy procedures     Same-day Surgery     23 Hour surgery.

These models require the following basic facilities and services: Reception, Pre-operative facilities, Operating Room (or Procedure Room), Recovery Stage 1, Recovery Stage 2, Inpatient Unit (IPU) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The difference between the models is the flow of patients from one unit to the next. The models may utilize some facilities and by-pass other facilities.  Inpatient Surgery  Patients undergoing Elective or Emergency surgery are first admitted to an IPU, ICU or are transferred from the Emergency Unit. After surgery, patients return to the IPU or ICU, but not Emergency Unit. Inpatient Surgery may start early (e.g. 7 am) and continue into the late hours of the evening.

Every surgical case performed as Day Surgery will save between 1 and 3 bed-days   1   as no IPU bed will be occupied by the patient. This will save costs whilst preserving valuable IPU beds for major inpatient surgery. Day Surgery patients should be organised to arrive very early (e.g. 6 am) with the aim of starting surgery at 7 am. Day Surgery patients will recover in the unit and go home before the evening.

Climate Control  Good temperature control and ventilation in treatment areas as work can be arduous for both patients and staff. It is important to remember that certain patients such as those with spinal cord injuries are unable to regulate their body temperature. It is therefore imperative that the gymnasium is air-conditioned. Regardless of orientation, there must be means of sun control.

This may be due to disease, injury, infection or genetic factors. Renal failure may be classified as either Acute Renal Failure or chronic Kidney Disease. Haemodialysis and Peritoneal dialysis services involve filtering the blood of excess fluid, and waste products normally filtered by the kidneys. Haemodialysis is a treatment for end stage renal failure where the function of the kidneys to remove substances from the blood is replaced by the use of a haemodialysis (dialysis) machine. Haemodialysis requires the patient to have one of the following - arterio-venous fistula, vein graft (artificial graft) or central line catheter inserted into their neck or upper","metadata":{"source":"iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","filename":"iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","path":"/Users/revienstech/Desktop/hem-server/pdf/iHFG_part_b_complete.pdf","loc":{"lines":{"from":1931,"to":1931}}}}],["2781",{"pageContent":"(dialysis) machine.

Haemodialysis may be undertaken in the following locations:     a hospital     a Satellite unit     a Stand-alone unit     a Self-care unit     at home. Peritoneal dialysis is an alternative to Haemodialysis.

Description  The Sterile Supply Unit’s role is to clean, decontaminate and store re-usable equipment and medical devices to ensure patient safety, compliance, efficiency and economy. Where viable, centralised Units minimize duplication and facilitate effective auditing while delivering a one way flow of items between soiled and clean areas. Service planning models will determine the size of each department. Where a full service is unavailable, external suppliers will be relied upon to maintain stock levels.  2   Functional and Planning Considerations  Operational Models  The size and role of the sterile goods supply service shall be clearly defined in the Operational Policy Statement.

However, cushioned vinyl may still be preferred to standard vinyl for its sound absorption  qualities.  Acoustic Properties  Carpet type finishes   can   not only   to   minimise noise generation, they also dampen the noise  generated by other sources. Carpet is particularly effective in corridor areas outside Patient  Bedrooms where a great deal of noise can be generated.

OH&S Issues  In areas where staff must stand for long periods of time, finishes should be chosen that do not  contribute to staff fatigue. Carpets and vinyls, cushioned and standard are widely considered to  be acceptable for lengthy standing.  Hard surfaces such as tiles, terrazzo or finished concrete are considered to be   too hard for  lengthy standing over several hours and alternatives are recommended in staff work areas.

Antistatic flooring reduces  the risk of static occurring while conductive flooring absorbs the electrical charge. However, if  rubber soled shoes are worn on conductive flooring the effe ct is negated.  In the past, anti - static flooring was required in Operating Rooms because of the use of flammable  anaesthetic agents. These types of anaesthetics are no longer in use, so the requirement for this  type of specialised flooring no longer applies   in Operating Rooms or Anaesthetic Rooms .  In addition, anti - static flooring is expensive, both to install and maintain.
